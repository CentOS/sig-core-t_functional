# This file contains list of tests we need/want to skip
# Reason is when there is upstream bug that we're aware of 
# So this file should contain:
#  - centos version (using $centos_ver)
#  - test to skip (tests/p_${name}/test.sh)
#  - reason why it's actually skipped (url to upstream BZ, or bug report)
# Separated by |
