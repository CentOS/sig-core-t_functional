<<<<<<< TZU
=======
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
>>>>>>> TAO
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Therefore let there always be non-being,
  so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
  so we may see their result.
The two are the same,
But after they are produced,
  they have different names.
<<<<<<< LAO
||||||| TZU
They both may be called deep and profound.
Deeper and more profound,
The door of all subtleties!
